This github will hold the data analysis and machine learning projects that I create using coding languages and other non-gui based tools. 

I am a Certified Public Accountant with a technology background and a robust skillset in using tools like PowerBi, Excel, and Alteryx to find answers or solve problems.

To improve my skillset, I have started working on programming projects to improve my data collecting, cleansing, and presentation skills at a more fundamental level.
